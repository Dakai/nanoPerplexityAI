## Answer
Yes, you can fly with your pet in Australia, but specific guidelines apply depending on the airline and the size of your pet. Here are some key points to consider:

- **Virgin Australia's Upcoming Service**: Virgin Australia plans to introduce pet-friendly flights, which will allow small dogs and cats to fly in designated rows under the seat, pending regulatory approval. This service is expected to launch within 12 months, with the airline currently able to accommodate pets on most domestic flights in cargo [1](https://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/travel-info/specific-travel/pets/) [3](https://newsroom.virginaustralia.com/release/cats-out-bag-virgin-australia-signals-intent-launch-nations-first-ever-pets-cabin-flights).

- **Other Airlines**: Currently, most major Australian airlines do not permit pets in the cabin and treat them as cargo. This policy is not expected to change soon, and pets are unlikely to be considered carry-on luggage [2](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-30/pets-on-planes/101028046).

- **Regulations and Compliance**: If you wish to fly with your pet, it's essential to check the specific rules and regulations of the airline you choose. These can differ significantly, especially regarding the size and breed of the animals allowed [5](https://www.ferndalekennels.com/en/blog/can-you-take-your-dog-on-a-plane-in-australia/).

For the most current information and specific inquiries, contacting the airline directly is advisable.

## Answer
The rules for flying with pets can vary significantly between different airlines in Australia. Here are some important points to consider:

- **Pet Check-in**: Most airlines allow pets to travel as excess baggage, which means they can be checked in to the cargo hold under specific conditions. However, if you choose this option, there are usually guidelines regarding the type and size of the pet carrier [1](https://petraveller.com.au/blog/domestic-air-travel-in-australia-with-your-pet).

- **Travel Agents for Relocation**: If you are not flying on the same flight as your pet, you may need to hire a pet relocation agent, which can depend on the airline's policies regarding unaccompanied pets [1](https://petraveller.com.au/blog/domestic-air-travel-in-australia-with-your-pet).

- **Preparation and Compliance**: Each airline sets its own rules concerning pet travel, including requirements for health certificates, vaccinations, and specific carrier dimensions. Therefore, it's crucial to prepare and comply with the regulations of the airline you select [4](https://blog.dogtainers.com.au/travelling-with-pets-guide/).

- **General Guidelines**: While it is generally possible to travel with pets domestically, the specific regulations and procedures can differ. Hence, it is advisable to review the pet policy of the airline you intend to use before planning your travel [2](https://www.rspcapetinsurance.org.au/pet-care/guides/pet-travel-guide).

In conclusion, while there are some commonalities, always check with the specific airline for their exact pet travel policies.

## Answer
The size restrictions for dogs flying on Australian airlines can vary based on the airline's specific policies. Here are the general guidelines:

- **Airline Policies**: Most airlines have specific rules regarding the size and weight of pets allowed to travel in the cabin versus those that must be transported as cargo. Generally, smaller dogs are permitted in the cabin if they can fit in a carrier that fits under the seat [5](https://www.ferndalekennels.com/en/blog/can-you-take-your-dog-on-a-plane-in-australia/).

- **Size Limits**: While exact dimensions may differ from one airline to another, typical limits for cabin travel often range between 5 to 8 kg (approximately 11 to 17 lbs) for the total weight of the pet and carrier combined. Larger dogs will usually need to be transported in the cargo hold [1](https://petraveller.com.au/blog/domestic-air-travel-in-australia-with-your-pet).

- **Virgin Australia Specifics**: Virgin Australia is expected to introduce pet-friendly flights allowing small cats and dogs on certain domestic routes, specifically in designated seats and under the seat in approved carriers [2](https://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/travel-info/specific-travel/pets/).

To ensure compliance, it is essential to check the specific size and weight restrictions set by the airline you choose for your travel.
