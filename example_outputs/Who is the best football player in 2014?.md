# Which one do you personally think is the best?

## Answer
Determining the "best" football player often comes down to personal opinion and criteria such as skill, achievements, and impact on the game. Two players frequently at the top of this discussion are Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi:

- **Cristiano Ronaldo**: Known for his incredible athleticism, goal-scoring ability, and versatility, Ronaldo has enjoyed success in multiple leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A) and has numerous individual awards, including five Ballon d'Or titles. His physical presence and work ethic make him a standout player [1](https://www.theguardian.com/football/datablog/2014/dec/24/the-worlds-best-footballers-in-2014-by-nationality-leagues-and-clubs).

- **Lionel Messi**: Renowned for his dribbling skills, vision, and playmaking ability, Messi has an equally impressive record with numerous awards and a significant number of goals. He is often celebrated for his creativity and finesse on the ball [1](https://www.messivsronaldo.app/club-stats/2013-2014//).

Ultimately, opinions on who is the best can vary widely among fans, analysts, and players themselves, reflecting personal preferences for different styles of play and contributions to the sport.
